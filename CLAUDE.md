# CLAUDE.md

sportbet_new is the TypeScript rebuild of [sportbet](https://github.com/tomyka/sportbet)
(PHP / Laravel), which stays in production until this project reaches parity.

**Read `docs/decisions.md` first.** It records what was decided before any
code - stack, database, safety rules, parity bar, infrastructure - and why.
Do not reopen a decision there without the owner.

The rules this app must reproduce are specified in the old repo's
`CLAUDE.md` and `CONTEXT.md` (`D:\Projects\sportbet`). Never invent a scoring,
ranking or league rule: if those files do not state it, ask the owner.

## Workflow

- Every substantive request becomes a GitHub issue in `tomyka/sportbet_new`,
  closed when its acceptance criteria are met.
- Substantial work goes brainstorm -> spec -> plan before code.
- Trunk-based: work lands on `main`.
